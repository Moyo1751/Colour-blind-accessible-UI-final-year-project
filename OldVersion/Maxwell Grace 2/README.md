## User Guide
### For developers who want to see the code you can do this is by
Right clicking on the file you want and opening it with your preferred text editor or IDE. 

Or you can open your IDE, click the file and open the whole folder there.
I recommend visual studio code (VS Code). It's very lightweight and easy to use. It also has plugins for several different programming languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, and more. A link to this IDE can be found below.

Simply choose the one for your operating system (Windows, Mac or Linux).

### For non-developers who want to see the code.
I recommend installing an IDE like Sublime, visual studio code (VS Code), and so on. it makes it easier and less stressful to view the code.

After installing the IDE simply click file and navigate to open folder. Click on it, go to where you have the code files stored and click on the code folder. Once this is done, you'll be able to click on any file you want and view the code. 

You can choose not to and simply right click and open with a text editor; But that approach is a bit stressful and regular text editors don't have the colour coding to help you differentiate certain keywords in code.
